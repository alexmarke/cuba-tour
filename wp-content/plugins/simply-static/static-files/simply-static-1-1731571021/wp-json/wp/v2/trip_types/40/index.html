{"id":40,"count":2,"description":"The workweek and weekend are those complementary parts of the week devoted to labor and rest, respectively. The legal working week , or workweek (American English), is the part of the seven-day week devoted to labor. In most of the Western world, it is Monday to Friday; the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. A weekday or workday is any day of the working week. Other institutions often follow the pattern, such as places of education. Sometimes the term \u201cweekend\u201d is expanded to include the time after work hours on the last workday of the week; e.g. Friday evening is often referred to as the start of the weekend.","link":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/trip-types\/weekend-trips\/","name":"Weekend Trips","slug":"weekend-trips","taxonomy":"trip_types","parent":0,"meta":[],"thumbnail":{"width":1631,"height":1080,"file":"2022\/03\/sky-night-countryside-adventure-summer-dusk-638123-pxhere.com-1.jpg","filesize":333680,"sizes":{},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/trip_types\/40"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/trip_types"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/taxonomies\/trip_types"}],"wp:post_type":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/trip?trip_types=40"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
