{"id":31,"count":4,"description":"Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.\r\n\r\nDespite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometers, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometers are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand meters.","link":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/activities\/paragliding\/","name":"Paragliding","slug":"paragliding","taxonomy":"activities","parent":0,"meta":[],"thumbnail":{"width":1920,"height":1080,"file":"2022\/03\/mountain-sky-mountain-range-flying-fly-freedom-67385-pxhere.com-1.jpg","filesize":152356,"sizes":{},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/activities\/31"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/activities"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/taxonomies\/activities"}],"wp:post_type":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/trip?activities=31"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
