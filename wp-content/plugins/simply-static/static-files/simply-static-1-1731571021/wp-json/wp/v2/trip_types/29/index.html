{"id":29,"count":14,"description":"An educational trail (or sometimes educational path), nature trail or nature walk is a specially developed hiking trail or footpath that runs through the countryside, along which there are marked stations or stops next to points of natural, technological or cultural interest. These may convey information about, for example, flora and fauna, soil science, geology, mining, ecology or cultural history. Longer trails, that link more widely spaced natural phenomena or structures together, may be referred to as themed trails or paths.","link":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/trip-types\/nature-walk\/","name":"Nature Walk","slug":"nature-walk","taxonomy":"trip_types","parent":0,"meta":[],"thumbnail":{"width":1920,"height":1271,"file":"2022\/03\/nature-forest-wilderness-mountain-dock-lake-306-pxhere.com-1.jpg","filesize":315787,"sizes":{},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/trip_types\/29"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/trip_types"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/taxonomies\/trip_types"}],"wp:post_type":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/trip?trip_types=29"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
