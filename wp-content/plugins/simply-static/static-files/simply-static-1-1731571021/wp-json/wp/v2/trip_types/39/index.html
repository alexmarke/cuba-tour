{"id":39,"count":15,"description":"Volunteering is generally considered an altruistic activity where an individual or group provides services for no financial or social gain \"to benefit another person, group or organization\". Volunteering is also renowned for skill development and is often intended to promote goodness or to improve human quality of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteering may have positive benefits for the volunteer as well as for the person or community served. It is also intended to make contacts for possible employment. Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster.","link":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/trip-types\/volunteer-trips\/","name":"Volunteer trips","slug":"volunteer-trips","taxonomy":"trip_types","parent":0,"meta":[],"thumbnail":{"width":1600,"height":1200,"file":"2022\/03\/group-france-child-instructor-education-excursion-1061472-pxhere.com-1.jpg","filesize":340979,"sizes":{},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/trip_types\/39"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/trip_types"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/taxonomies\/trip_types"}],"wp:post_type":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/cuba-tour\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/trip?trip_types=39"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
